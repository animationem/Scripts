# Scripts

This repository is mainly to try and help improve workflow efficiency for 3D artists in 3D applications such as: Maya, Houdini, Nuke, etc...

This also includes some Linux Systems Admin scripts that could be helpful if artists want to start getting into their own hardware development, studio, or assist their IT staff. 

If you have any questions, please send me an email. I really hope the scripts can be of benefit to you!
